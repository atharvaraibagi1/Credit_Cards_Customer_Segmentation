## **K-Means Clustering**

### **Elbow Method**
The optimal number of clusters was determined using the elbow plot method, which showed that 3 clusters best represented the data.

### **Clusters Identified**
After performing K-Means clustering, the dataset was divided into three distinct clusters based on customer behavior:

- **High Credit Utilization Customers**
  - **Key Traits**:
    - High revolving balance-to-credit limit (0.618906).
    - High spending ratio (0.319330).
    - Low remaining credit (0.031564).
  - **Demographic Insights**: Middle-aged customers with mid-to-high incomes. They manage their spending responsibly and depend heavily on credit limits.
  - **Behavioral Summary**: Frequent card users who maintain a high revolving balance.

- **Balanced Usage Customers**
  - **Key Traits**:
    - Moderate revolving balance-to-credit limit (0.117687).
    - Moderate spending ratio (0.177295).
    - Moderate remaining credit (0.169929).
  - **Demographic Insights**: Middle-aged or younger customers with moderate incomes. They prioritize financial stability and use credit cards cautiously.
  - **Behavioral Summary**: Low-risk users with high financial discipline.

- **Conservative Users**
  - **Key Traits**:
    - Very low revolving balance-to-credit limit (0.044101).
    - Very low spending ratio (0.036409).
    - Extremely high remaining credit (0.738300).
  - **Demographic Insights**: Younger or mid-aged individuals with low-to-mid incomes. They have high borrowing capacity but prefer conservative spending.
  - **Behavioral Summary**: They tend to pay off balances in full, avoiding interest accumulation.
